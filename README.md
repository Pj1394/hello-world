# hello-world
#First Repository and message to my future self. 


First repository. Creating repository,creating branch, commit, open pull request, merge pull request

My name is Phillip Jones and i'm a senior at Georgia State University. 
Major is Computer information systems with a concentration in software development.
I'm a little late to the Git patry as this is my second programming class and i'm JUST now creating a repository. 

My code will be bad....but spaghettii code will NOT define me for long. 

Looking forward to working with you all and to my future self...

DONT QUIT....you've come so far and in a few years...we'll look at the nights of no sleep and anxiety of looking at a problem 
and really know how to help others who follow the same path.
